# There's one line for each partition, plus a line for the sender (indicated by a partition id of -1).
# Each non-sender line has the following information:
#    * the partition id (0-n, where n+1 is the number of partitions)
#    * list of publishers of data intended for that partition. There should be as many publishers as there are
#      partitions. In fact, each publisher itself is associated with a partition (since partitions are the source of
#      keyed data). Each publisher listed has a prefix of "x>", where x is a partition id, that indicates the
#      partition associated with that publisher.
# The sender line has the following information:
#    * a partition id of -1
#    * a list of publishers provided by the sender. The sender has a publisher for each partition. A partition
#      should subscribe to the publisher for its partition id (indicated by the prefix "x>", where x is a partition
#      id). For each outgoing event, the sender will randomly choose a publisher on which to emit the event.
